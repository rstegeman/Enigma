# Enigma
A  one-to-one recreation of an Enigma Machine.

Notes:
  1. You cannot customize your settings prior to encryption (That would make the code too easy to crack haha)
  2. the positive code and negative code are analogous to the positive and negative ends of the plugs used to scramble the machine's plugboard
